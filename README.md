# libraryApp

This is my Library App project for the Odin Project course.

## Description

This was made as a part of my Odin Project library app, we had to use objects for the books stored in an array for the functionality and we returned to the application to also integrate the use of classes into the project. This was a fun project to introduce us to the use of objects and arrays and how we can create a useable database of information within our sites and generate DOM structures accordingly.

I went for a lighter design relying on emojis for the icons giving control of the device you are using for the styling to try and achieve a more cohesive design within your own system. Additionally, I worked on button visual feedback to try and give a sense of satisfaction when an action is performed, such as deleting a book.

To return to this project I would like to move the add book functionality to a self-generating form through the DOM as an overlay item and also add JSON into the project to save a copy of your library to return to after you have left the site so when you return your books are re-loaded with their read status saved.
